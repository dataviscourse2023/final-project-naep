    <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as "The Nation's Report Card" is administered to school samples to mesure educational progress in the United States. The Long-Term Trend (LTT) assessment is the oldest of the assessments in the NAEP portfolio with reading data dating back to 1971 and math data back to 1978. Assessments are given at grades 4, 8, and 12. More information is at <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">The official NAEP website.</a>.</p>

    <p>Standardized assessments scores are reported on arbitrary scales. The NAEP LTT data use a scale from 0 to 500. However, all reported data range between 185 and 375. As there are no units and the scale is arbitrary, it doesn't matter if the visualization is rooted at zero.</p>
    
    <p>Most NAEP visualizations that I have encountered simply show the a line chart letting you interpret trends, up or down, but don't offer reference points. This is unfortunate because the NAEP organization has gone to considerable effort with committees of expert educators to set achievement levels of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced for each grade and subject. The visualizations I present here let you interpret progress (or lack thereof) relative to those standards.</p>

    <p>The graphs I present here show three lines, All students, Male, and Female. The data I have retrieved categories of: regions of the country, disability status, English language learners, race/ethnicity, economic disadvantage, and community category (City, Suburb, Town, Rural). In the final project you will be able to select which grades and subjects to display (each on its own graph) and which categories to show (in lines on each graph). Much like Homework 4, hovering over a graph with the mouse will display the detailed numbers.</p>
